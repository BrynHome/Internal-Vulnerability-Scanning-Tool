# LAN Vulnerability Scanning Tool

## Purpose
The aim of this project was to create an all in one, LAN Vulnerability Detection
application, that uses Device Discovery, Service Scanning and Fingerprinting, and Vulnerability
detection through specialized scripts and comparison of the obtained network data to
vulnerability databases.  
Once collected, the results from the scans will be collected in raw form where it can either be
read as is or compiled to a readable PDF format that will detail the results of the scanning. 
Through my experiences in the network security course, I’ve recognized the difficulty of
manually providing upkeep to a network no matter how small. While it is the most sure-fire way
of keeping your network secure, once you get to larger network environments, manual upkeep is
no longer realistic. There are too many different environments with different needs to effectively
provide support. This is where tools come in, like a vulnerability scanner, which can assist and
automate to an extent the upkeep of your network by detecting issues before they are exploited.

## Goals and Objectives
The goal of this project is to create an application that supports the major facets of Vulnerability Scanning for an Internal Network, complete with the following features:
- ARP Based Device Discovery
- TCP SYN Port Scanning
- UDP Port Scanning
- Service Fingerprinting
- Vulnerability Detection
- Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability Detection
- SYN Flood DoS Vulnerability Detection <br />

The implementation is intended as a “Working Prototype”, that can be built upon further, ideally into a full-fledged Penetration tester application.
