	-Script to automatically configure a device?
	-develop software to test ports?
		-develop software to listen to network traffic and send data to remote host? or to steal data if available
	SCOPE
		DHCP must be enable. Because this is the case, this attack will not work on more highly secure environments that require authentication for devices before an IP can be given out

Narrow scope to just testing a specific service? 
	Apache servers are extremely common, and have a long history of exploits. This could be a good place to start. https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-45/Apache.html

		- Clients request data using a name
		- this name can represent:
			- chunks of files
			- chunk of video
			- fragment of real-time voice(voice chat)
			- health data
			- etc
		- this eliminates need for protocol or port numbers, as everything is in the name
		- the data contains:
			the requested content, a command ack, or  the result of processing
			meta info about the content
			crypto signiture to bind "content" and "name"

Innovation, complexity, technologically challenging
